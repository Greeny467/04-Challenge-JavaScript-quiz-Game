# 04-Challenge-JavaScript-quiz-Game

##  What is this?
Designed for a schooling project, this application acts as a quiz game on JavaScript api basics. Its main features are a highscore which is kept track of through local storage, a working quiz, and a timer which ends the game when it reaches 0. If the player has beaten the previous highscore, they can enter their own 3 character name and it will be recorded along with their score as the new highscore.

## For the grading team
I utilized different snippets of code from stack overflow and other websites when looking for solutions to my problems, as well as some help in understanding my errors and minor problem solving from chat gpt. All of these would be found within the java script file.
